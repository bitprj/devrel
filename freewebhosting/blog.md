# Where can I host my website for free? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each provider?

Building your own website can be confusing and complicated, and in looking for a service to host your website you may be overwhelmed by all the options and not know exactly what you are paying for. Here we have put together a simple list of free web hosts and the advantages/disadvantages of each provider.

## First off, you may be wondering, what is web hosting?
![alt text](https://www.website.com/img/skin/what_is_web_hosting.jpg)

Web hosting is a service that allows you to post a website on the internet. It is basically the physical location of your website on the internet. Web hosting providers have the servers where your website data is stored and are responsible for making that data visible on the internet. Web hosting services are usually chosen depending on how much disk space and bandwidth you need. If you have a lot of customer interaction on your site you may want a service that offers more bandwidth, and if you have a lot of content on your site you may want a service that offers more disk space.  

## With disk space and bandwidth in mind here is a list of free web hosting services that you could choose to host your website:

### 000WebHost.com

000WebHost.com is a free web hosting service, and their $0/month plan offers 10 GB of bandwidth and 1GB of disk space. Their plan offers pretty good speed and also includes a no ad policy which creates a user friendly space for your website.

The disadvantages of 000WebHost.com are that their average uptime is 99.7%. Uptime is the measure of uninterrupted time that a hosting system experiences (when your hosting service is available), and the ideal uptime would 100% (which means there is no downtime). Having an uptime of 99.7% means that users can expect an average of one hour a week of downtime every other week on your site.

The bandwidth and disk space that 000WebHost.com offers is not a lot, and there have been complaints that there is no customer support for when you encounter a technical issue. 

### InfinityFree.net

InfinityFree.net offers unlimited bandwidth and storage space. Their free plan includes a no front-end ad policy and has good speed in addition to 99.9% uptime. Some bonuses that come with an InfinityFree.net plan are a free SSL certificate, which allows your website to move from HTTP to HTTPS which is more secure. In addition with the plan you get 10 email accounts and an FTP account.

While an InfinityFree.net plan has a lot to offer, their terms of service includes a lot of limitations and restrictions in terms of what content you are allowed to upload, and if you are found “non-compliant” with their restrictions your site could be suspended or eliminated. 

### Wix

Wix.com functions as a free website builder that offers free website hosting. They have a wide variety of templates that are easy to use in addition to a free subdomain and SSL certificate. With their free plan you get 500MB of disk space and 500 MB of bandwidth. 

Some disadvantages of Wix.com’s free plan are that you are very limited in the amount of disk space and bandwidth that you get with their free plan, and also Wix will display ads on your website if you are on the free plan. Another disadvantage of using the Wix.com free hosting plan is you are stuck with a subdomain that has “.wixsite.com” attached to it.  Wix.com also has plans where you can upgrade to have no ads on your site, get more disk space or bandwidth, and customize your own domain name. 


### Sites.Google.com

Sites.Google.com also functions as a free website builder, and they offer responsive templates, a free subdomain and an SSL certificate. Sites.Google.com has a no ad policy. The amount of disk space and bandwidth offered is unknown, but their plan is known to have very good uptime and speed. 

The disadvantages for using Sites.Google.com as a website builder is that their styling options are very limited, and there is no option to create your own custom domain name. Your website’s default domain name will be https://sites.google.com/ + (your site name)

### AwardSpace.com

Some features that AwardSpace.com offers are ad free hosting, customer service and guaranteed 99% uptime. Their free plan includes a subdomain, 5GB or bandwidth and 1GB disk space. 

The amount of disk space and bandwidth that AwardSpace.com offers a big disadvantage, as it does not allow you to have that much content on your site. In looking at reviews for AwardSpace.com, a glaring problem is their uptime averages to be 99.5% which equates to about more than one hour of downtime per week (more than that of 000WebHost.com).

Happy website building!

Keep in mind that although there is an array of expenses that could be required in order to create a successful website, and while it may be tempting to try and cut costs wherever possible, free web hosts are not always what they market themselves to be. There are also many other low cost (not free)  web hosting services that you may want to check out!
