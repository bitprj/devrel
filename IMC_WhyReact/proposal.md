# Step 1

## TITLE:
What's with all the craze about React?

## TOPIC:
React

## DESCRIPTION:
In this blog, I will explore the reasons behind React's enormous rise in popularity as the go-to web dev framework. I will give an overview of the React philosophy, describe features about React that make it so useful and convenient, and explain how it expands and develops. I will also give a brief historical overview of web dev pre-React and compare and contrast React to vanilla JavaScript. I will finish off by giving some practical examples of projects that are made much easier to build via using React to highlight its usefulness.

# Step 2

## TARGET AUDIENCE:
I am writing this blog for people who are beginning to learn about web dev and have an interest in learning React or have just started learning it. This is not a blog for experienced React users, since I think they will already know most of what the blog covers. 

# Step 3

## Beginning:
Introduce what React is and its place in the world of web dev. Acknowledge its popularity and spark the reader's interest in understanding why it is so widely used in dynamic web apps.

## Middle:
Give a historical overview of how dynamic web apps were made pre-React. Go over jQuery and its uses. Then lead into the rise of React, and explain how React works. Compare and contrast it to jQuery, emphasize its strengths. Briefly go over some weaknesses of React.

## End:
Highlight some code examples of how React can be used in projects. Guide the reader towards resources and/or project ideas to further their learning.
