What is an IMC?

From workshops and tutorials presented by students to massive livestreamed webinars hosted by professors and industry professionals, Bit Project's mission is to provide our student community with the resources they need to successfully implement any project they envision.

Integrated Marketing Campaigns (IMCs) channel Bit Project's multiple teams, resources, and communication platforms to empower our student community to develop valuable technical education content.

Designers, developers, editors, and engineerings all come together to build collaborative and interactive learning experiences
