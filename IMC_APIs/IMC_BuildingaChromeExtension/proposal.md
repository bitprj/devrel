**TITLE:**    
Building a Chrome Extension: Workshop

**TOPIC:**    
API's/Chrome

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
In this workshop, I plan to give a beginner's guide to chrome extensions. I will introduce the languages one can use for this project and explain why each is useful.  I will also offer a step-by-step walkthrough on how to get the most confusing parts done.  I want to make this workshop interactive so I will build my own chrome extension and walk through how I did it and how you can use it.  I think I will build a chrome extension that allows you to add words to a list and the extension will censor those words on any site you visit as long as the extension is turned on.

:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
My audience for this workshop are students who would like to learn more about chrome and are interested in building their own extension.  Though I hope to target this video towards beginners, I believe everyone interested in taking something away from this workshop should have some experience with JavaScript/HTML/CSS or else they'll be lost.  With that being said, the example I'll be walking through should be fairly simple so someone who wants to make a complex or advanced extension should probably do some further research.

> Outline your learning/teaching structure: 

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
Here, I'll go over the languages you need to know and the programs I'll be using in the tutorial. I want to go over this as early in the video as possible to help viewers have a better understanding of what they need to know to be able to make a chrome extension.  This will also help people who have enough experience with the languages I'm going to use to prepare themselves by downloading the correct software.

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
This is where I'll do a brief summary of a chrome extension and how to approach making one.  I'm going to try to do a walkthrough with slides here to just explain what you have to do so that people who learn best by taking notes can be more successful.  I think this will also just prove to be useful to those who want to write down key terms and ideas to help them remember this workshop in the future.

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
Finally, I am going to walk through making the censor chrome extension.  Though I'm writing this under the "end" section of the outline, I believe this will take up at least half of the video's length.  This will be very in depth and detailed and I will highlight the ideas and steps mentioned in my slideshow to help viewers better vizualize what to do in each step.
