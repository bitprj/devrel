What is an IMC?
---

From workshops and tutorials presented by students to massive livestreamed webinars hosted by professors and industry professionals, Bit Project's mission is to provide our student community with the resources they need to successfully implement any project they envision.

Integrated Marketing Campaigns (IMCs) channel Bit Project's multiple teams, resources, and communication platforms to empower our student community to develop valuable technical education content.

Designers, developers, editors, and engineerings all come together to build collaborative and interactive learning experiences

8 Week Structure
---

Our organization works on educational content development  by developing 8-week IMCs from ideation to post-production. The 8 week structure provides developers a way to find like-minded peers and create large scale education content together. Each developer creates blog tutorials about their own coding projects and the team works together under a Project Manager to build and promote a webinar to demonstrate the projects.

Below is a guide to the 8 week structure.

### Week 0: Proposals

:hatching_chick: **==President==** IMC Proposal 

> :pushpin: Open IMC Proposal Issue

<details><summary>Proposals</summary>


- Goal: PM your own IMC
- All PMs and directors are expected to identify IMC topics and discuss to their supervisors
- Not all ideas will be used
  - Being more involved in IMC topic generation will likely mean you can PM something you're really interested in
- Coming up with your own IMC Proposals
  - Check for existing blogs
  - Gage demand and interests
  - What is something you want to work on?
  - What do you need to make this happen?
  - What if many people want to do the same IMC?
    - Most IMCs will be popular and can be repeated
    - Instead of having large IMC teams, it's best to schedule another IMC Proposal for that topic for the future and ask devs to wait until then
