# IMC Plan

## Postman - COVID19

### :pushpin: Step 1
**TITLE:**    
IMC-C19

**TOPIC:**    
Postman

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
This IMC primarily focuses on walking users, who have little to no experience, through Postman to develop their experience with APIs. However, one of the other takeaways for the webinar is that attendees will be more knowledgable on how technologists are able to play a role in real-life scenarios (such as mitigating COVID-19). In order to accomplish this task, the webinar will utilize data on COVID-19, provided by Johns Hopkins University, to guide users on how to visualize data using Postman. Additionally, the webinar will feature several key speakers to enhance the user's understanding/experience. We plan to have speakers from the perspective of: a front-line doctor, a UC Davis Professor of Virology, and a speaker from RapidAPI who will share how to access public/free/premium APIs.  

### :pushpin: Step 2
:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
Our target audience primarily consists of high-school students and freshman in college who have little to no exposure to APIs. However, the webinar will be open to anyone who would like to learn more about Postman/APIs. For our webinar, even staff from different universities were encouraged to attend.
