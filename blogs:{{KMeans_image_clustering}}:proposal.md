Anyone can observe an image and pick out the colors that appear. Looking at the image above, we see a random,heterogenous assortment of colors that make up some cloud object thats almost gas-like, and a black background. If given the task to reproduce this image on paper or even as a wall mural, how would you do it? One might start by finding enough black paint. Also, another restriction is that you're only given a decently sized basket to hold all material you need, so considering the proportion that black takes up on this image, you decide to fill half your basket with black paint bottles. What color comes next? There is a nice amount of yellow on both sides of the image. Then, red and a bit of green and blue. Okay, you've figured out the what colors are required and what quantity. However, the marketing campaign intends to repeat the process for an array of pictures and would like you figure out the inventory of colors per image. How would automate the task without having to observe each image?

 - It would be time consuming to shuffle through each picture, observe its colors and try to gauge the proportion each colors takes up. Take for instance the provide picture above. If were able to consider the image as a matrix, or a table, of descriptive numbers that inform us of the images pixels and colors, perhaps we could pick out similarities in the picture. One observation might be "Which of the many pixels are are colored black,red,blue....etc? What characteristic(s) do these colored pixels have that differentiate them from the other colors? Once these characteristics are made, we repeat and try to improve on the segregation of these pixels until there is no further improvement. That is, continuation would not provide much more beneficial outcome. This process is called K-Means clustering, and it has been used by businesses to identify their best
customers by buying behavior. Movie or prodcut recommendation systems also use a clustering technique to provide you with suggested alternatives to items you've enjoyed.

 - Its going to consist of a step-by-step tutorial code and documentation on the tools, packages and code chunks necessary to go from uploading an image and reaching the end goal of obtaining exactly colors exist in that image.

- You were able to upload an image, and extract however many colors exist in that image. Next time you are tasked with turning a small pixeled image into a massive billboard, and you needed to know which colors are needed and in what quantity, you would be able too. Heck, you can do it for 10,20 or even 100 images all automitically!
