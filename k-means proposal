{{Introduction to K-Means Clustering Analysis: Base on Titanic passenger survival prediction Model}}
TOPIC:
{{ K-Means Algorism}}

DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):
{{K-means method is an unsupervised learning algorithm, which can solve the clustering problem. In this blog, I will introduce the basic theory of this algorithm. Besides, I will use Titanic passenger survival prediction Model to carry out how to implement the k-means method in Python. Finally, I will introduce the disadvantage of this method and the advantage of this method.}}
