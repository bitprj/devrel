TITLE:
Introduction to K-Means Clustering Analysis: Base on Titanic passenger survival prediction Model

TOPIC:
K-Means Algorism

DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):
K-means method is an unsupervised learning algorithm, which can solve the clustering problem. 
In this blog, I will introduce the basic theory of this algorithm. 
Besides, I will use Titanic passenger survival prediction Model to carry out how to implement the k-means method in Python. 
I may show the correctly rate of the model result.
Finally, I will introduce the disadvantage of this method and the advantage of this method.
