### :pushpin: Step 1

**TITLE:**    
Intro to Multiple Linear Regression Analysis in Python

**TOPIC:**    
Statistics

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
A step-by-step tutorial on multiple linear regression analysis; the process involves checking assumptions, calculating coefficients using different techniques, making predictions, and evaluating performances under different models. These models include OLS, Lasso/Ridge, and Elastic Net.

### :pushpin: Step 2

:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
People who have a basic understanding of elementary statistics topics such as confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, and are interested in obtaining estimates from multiple predictors with basic regression techniques.

### :pushpin: Step 3

> Outline your learning/teaching structure: 

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
Begin by explaining the usage of multiple linear regression analysis and preparing an example dataset.

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
Show how the analysis can be applied to the dataset using a simplest model. Apart from performing the regression itself, its conditions, interpretations, and applications are also explained. 

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
Introduce some more complicated techniques such as stepwise regression and regularizations, and compare their results and performances.
