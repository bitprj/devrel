### :pushpin: Step 1
**TITLE:**    
Calculator with React Hooks and the React Context API

**TOPIC:**    
JavaScript, React

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
Creating a tutorial on how to code a 4 function calculator using React with Hooks (specifically useState, UseContext, UseEffect) tossed in to show how they can be used. I will briefly go over what hooks are in the beginning of the tutorial. This video is targeted at people that have some knowledge of JavaScript and React but haven't used its Hook APIs yet. Each function of the calculator will get at least one slide but I will begin with the HTML/JSX code.

### :pushpin: Step 3
> Outline your learning/teaching structure: 

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
I will introduce what React Hooks are and how they can be used before I create the calculator. The I'll construct the format and syling of the calculator before jumping into its functionality.

**Middle and End (2-3+ sentences):**    
Coding the calculator itself, implementing the Hooks, and maybe also showing how this approach differs from using classes. I will elaborate more on the JavavScript and JSX than the CSS.
