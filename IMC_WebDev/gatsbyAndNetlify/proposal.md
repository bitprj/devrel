### :pushpin: Step 1
**TITLE:**    
Deploy your first website on Gatsby and Netlify

**TOPIC:**    
Web Development

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
A guide on how to deploy a website built with Gatsby on Netlify. I'll be going over what these technologies are and what you'll need to know to build the website itself ( e.g. JavaScript, React). I'll present a step by step process that is easy for anyone to follow and add GIFs for anything that needs more visualization.

### :pushpin: Step 2
:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
Anyone who has built a website using Gastby and wants to deploy it. Anyone looking to build a website and wants to know where to start and then how they can deploy it. Minimal technical knowledge expected (i.e. very basic knowledge of the terminal, git, and their preferred text editor).

### :pushpin: Step 3
> Outline your learning/teaching structure: 

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
I'll start with a short explanation on what Gatsby and Netlify are as well as explain what it means to deploy a website. I will also briefly go over Node.js and npm and they are needed to install Gatsby.

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
Install Node.js and Gatsby. Create new Netlify account, and repo (you can use GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab but I'll be using GitHub). OAuth setup between Netlify and Github. Finally, deploying the site.

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
Netlify will create a new build every time changes are pushed to the master branch. I'll be showing this off.
