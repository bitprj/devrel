DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences): As a beginner with GraphQL, including myself, fetching data from APIs in a proper way has been always a knotty question when it comes to learn about GraphQL. In this blog, I will present some efficient and simple ways of implementing	GraphQL to fetch data from APIs. Mainly, we will build a simple client to communicate with APIs by sending http requests. I will introduce these in a simple and beginner-friendly way, so people who are learning GraphQL from scratch can understand it with ease. Also, in the section of implementation	, I will give some techniques and tools of fetching.
