What is it?
Google AMP is a web component framework that is specifically designed to prioritize the user experience. In context, Google AMP is helpful for developers when engaging their audiences through ads, emails, websites, and stories. 

How Does it Work?
Businesses use Google AMP as a framework to design their ads, emails, websites, or stories to increase user engagement. When a business is creating an ad for their company, Google AMP allows the company to choose and use different web components to allow for more engagement from users.

Take this ad that Google uses as a demo to show how Google AMP is implemented:

These images show how this company used Google AMP to make their ads more engaging for their viewers. Allowing users to interact with the buttons on the ad will essentially increase the user’s viewing time. There are numerous interactive features that Google AMP has that companies have the option of choosing when creating an ad, website, story, or email. Whether it is an interactive button that takes the user to a different screen or an arrow button that allows the user to scroll through a variety of pictures.

Your website and pages will have fewer designs of your brand because Google AMP transforms websites into a more Google-styled site instead of having your own unique branding.

Ads that usually pop up on Google AMP websites may be eliminated making your ads less viewed by your customers. Though users will most likely spend more time on your site, you may lose money due to the fact that some of your ads won’t be seen.

There is a different display of sites from desktop to mobile which viewers will notice and can cause difficulties towards your websites capabilities. Content may be different depending on which device the user is viewing on which is important to take into account for developers.











So should you use Google AMP?
At the end of the day it does depend on what you value in your company. Whether it is branding or views or your ads, there are both many pros and cons to what Google AMP has to offer. Using AMP as a whole does seem easy to set up even if you already have many websites or ads so on the developer side it is fairly simple to integrate into the style of a company’s sites. Many companies that made a switch to Google AMP have reaped the benefits of the user engagement focus and have increased in profit overall which is a big plus when considering the use of Google AMP. Ultimately, it does depend on what a company values and what you are willing to give up for Google AMP.
