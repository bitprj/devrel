## Background 
### What is a Chatbot?

A Chatbot is a software that you can “chat with.” You can find Chatbots in messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger, or on websites through pop-ups. They can also be integrated with “virtual assistants” for customer service or tech support. Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa are both great examples.

With the rapid improvements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), it has never been easier to create a Chatbot. If you pay  attention to the structures of modern websites, you will notice that most of them use an existing Chatbot integrated with the web pages. These bots are considered smart Chatbots as they have the ability to understand language structures. Although limited in general, they provide all the necessary components of a virtual assistant to help you navigate a website. Let's see how easy is it to create a Chatbot!

First, let’s look into why we might need a Chatbot:

- **Navigation:** You want to help a user navigate through a website.
- **Information:** Search for news relevant to you.
- **Customer Assistance:** Your business requires a lot of customer assistance and you want to automate responses to complaints that do not require urgent attention.
- **Social-Automation:** Automate restaurant reservations.
- **Curiosity:** You just want to explore the limits of computer intelligence (or trickery, see the image below ⬇️)

### Why are Chatbots important for business?

There are a massive amount of active users online these days. Chatbots make it much easier to offer customer service. They can interact with multiple users at the same time and work 24 hours a day. They provide users with helpful information to enhance customer experience while reducing the cost of traditional customer service, and prevent your team from always answering the same FAQs.

As you can see, the advantages of a Chatbot are far-reaching. Fortunately for us, there are frameworks and services which make it relatively easy to create information-based bots.


### What is Google Dialogflow?

For this tutorial, we will be using Google's **DialogFlow**. DialogFlow is a powerful NLU API that was acquired and is now developed by Google. It gives users new ways to interact with your product by building engaging voice and text-based conversational interfaces, such as voice apps and Chatbots, powered by AI. You can connect with users on your website, mobile app, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and other popular platforms and devices.

What makes DialogFlow so useful and popular:

- Powered by Google’s Machine Learning
- Built on Google infrastructure
- Optimized for the Google Assistant
- It is very user friendly, intuitive and is one of the best NLP models out there

## Building Blocks

**Agents:**
DialogFlow allows you to make Natural language understanding (NLU) modules called agents. The agent is the main component of your bot. It connects to your backend and provides it with your custom logic. Agents are made up of intents. 

**Intents:**
Intents are actions that a user can perform on your agent. You can set up as many intents as you want for your agent. When a user says something, DialogFlow will match the expression with one of the intents that you created. For example, you may have a “Shipping” intent. When a user asks “What are the shipping methods?“ the Chatbot will match it with the “Shipping” intent. In this way, the bot recognizes the relevant term and can formulate the correct response. However, if the Chatbot doesn't find any intents to match with the user input, it won't respond to the user. Thus, it's important to make sure you create enough intents to cover all significant questions. The Chatbot knows which intent to call by using entities.

**Entities:**
Entities map what a user says to what action should be taken. Any information that is critical to your business logic will be an entity. This includes things like dates, email addresses, and any other keyword categories that users may ask about. For example, “order number” can be an entity that will get called when a user enters an order number. This entity can be linked to an “Order” intent which can deal with all the possible problems for an order.

## Tutorial

### Download the template files

From GitHub, download the [Verily COVID-19 Pathfinder virtual agent template](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid19-rapid-response-demo/blob/master/agent-template/covid-19-agent-template.zip) and its associated [fulfillment code](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/covid19-rapid-response-demo/blob/master/agent-template/dialogflow-fulfillment.zip).

### Create an Agent

1. Go to the [Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/).
2. If requested, sign in to the Dialogflow console. See [DialogFlow console overview](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/console) for more information.
3. Click **Create Agent** on the left menu. (If you already have other agents, click the agent name, scroll to the bottom and click **Create new agent**.)
4. Enter your agent’s name, default language, default time zone, and GCP project, then click the **Create** button. (You can change the [agent edition and pricing plan](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/editions) after creation.)
5. Click the settings button.
6. Select the **Export and Import** tab, then click the **Import from Zip** button to [import the template](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/agents-settings#export) you downloaded above.

### Enable and deploy fulfillment with the Inline Editor

To enable and deploy the default fulfillment code, use the Inline Editor:

1. Click **Fulfillment** in the left sidebar.
2. Toggle the switch to [enable the Inline Editor](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/fulfillment-inline-editor).
3. If you did not [enable billing in setup steps](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/setup#billing), you are prompted to enable billing now. Cloud Functions have associated charges, but the service is free up to a [significant number of monthly invocations](https://cloud.google.com/functions/pricing).
4. Click **Deploy** at the bottom of the form and wait until dialogs indicate that it has been deployed.
5. Go to the Google Cloud Console and select Cloud Functions on the left panel.
6. Select the fulfillment for the function you created and click the **Edit** button.
7. Under the **Source code** section, select **ZIP upload** and upload the fulfillment zip file you downloaded above. Select a Stage bucket (you may need to create one if it hasn’t been created yet).
8. Follow the instructions in the Google Maps Platform [quickstart](https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started?&_ga=2.151893690.2050009114.1588390420-45888550.1587369863#quickstart) to enable the Google Maps **Places API**. Select **API & Services > Credentials** in the console to create an API key for calling the Places API (See [Get an API Key](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key) for more information).

### Using Dialogflow Messenger

1. Go to the [Dialogflow Console](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your agent.
3. Click **Integrations** in the left sidebar menu.
4. Enable the [**Dialogflow Messenger**](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/dialogflow-messenger) integration.
5. Paste the embed code shown on the dialog in a webpage on your website. To interact with the agent on your site, click the icon at the bottom right, type your input query, and press Enter. The agent responds.
6. [Customize the agent](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/integrations/dialogflow-messenger#html_customizations) to appear the way you want it.

### Using the Dialogflow API

To interact with your agent using the Dialogflow API, ensure that your Google Cloud Platform project is properly [set up](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/setup), then submit a natural language query about COVID-19 and detect its intent.

1. Create a request.json file that includes a natural language query about COVID-19. For example:

   ```json
    {
      "query_input": {
         "text": {
             "text": "how to get tested",
             "language_code": "en-US"
           }
        }
      }
   
   // See the detectIntent page for details about the JSON format.
   // page: https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/reference/rest/v2/projects.agent.sessions/detectIntent#request-body
   ```

2. Run the following command to send a detect intent request to your agent.

```json
curl -X POST 

        -H "Authorization: Bearer "$(gcloud auth application-default print-access-token) 

        -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8" 

        -d @request.json 

        https://dialogflow.googleapis.com/v2/projects/project-id/agent/sessions/session-id:detectIntent
```

**Note:** There are many [other ways](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/docs/quick/api#detect_intent) (C#, Go, Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, etc) to interact with the API.


## Conclusion

Congratulations! Now you know how to create a smart Chatbot that gives useful information related to COVID-19. In this tutorial, we showed the easy-to-use tools available such as Google Cloud Platform and Google DiaLog Flow to develop our Chatbot. We used a little bit of coding to connect our user inputs with relevant intents. Remember the framework we used is not just limited to this scenario. In fact, Google cloud services along with DialogFlow can be used to make any sort of information or action Chatbot, from news to personal finances. It is also a fun activity to test the limits of this technology and improve them!
