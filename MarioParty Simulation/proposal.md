**TOPIC**
{Data simulation}

**DESCRIPTION**
{I'll start with the generation of data from the simulations. From that data, we can see which character leads to the most efficient traversal of the map in Mario Party 8. I'll include graphs of the results from the simulations. In mario party, different characters have their special dice that will either take away coins, give them coins, or move them forwards on the board depending on which side it lands on. The game is won with stars and one way to get a star is by reaching the end of the board.}

**Beginning**
{Let's start by introducing Mario Party 8 and giving some background info on the different availiable dice. We'll discuss how winning in the game works: stars awarded for traversing the map, minigames, and stealing stars from opponents. Here we'll also introduce the basic concept of data simulation.}

**Middle**
{Let's cover a bit more about data simulation and why we need to do it. I'll give a quick runthrough of the code and how it works. To wrap up this section, I'll present the results from the simulations in both table and graph forms.}

**End**
{Here we'll analyze the data and draw our conclusion as to which character is best for getting around the map. We can discuss some other factors that can skew our results significantly. Now with this newfound data, we can demolish our friends at Mario Party. :) }
