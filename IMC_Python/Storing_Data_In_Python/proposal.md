**TITLE:**    
Storing Data in Python

**TOPIC:**    
Beginning to Code & Introduction to Python

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
This article introduces and explores the three major data structures for storing information in Python - lists, sets, and dictionaries.  It serves to aid those with little to no experience with Python in choosing the correct array-type for their program.  Not only does this blog thoroughly define each array type, but it also lists the methods that can be used with each type and gives examples on how to use them.  The blog also uses a Venn diagram to highlight the properties that the are unique to each data structure and the properties that they share.  Lastly, the article points outs some bonus methods for each data structure - describing why each is useful and how these functions can help you decide on a way for storing your data.

:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
This article is intended for those who are new to Python and possibly new to coding overall.  I wrote this blog in the simplest terms I could think of and tried my best to explain concepts that may be familiar to me, but could be unfamiliar to my audience.  However, this blog is also designed so that it can easily be skimmed for those who know Python and are just trying to re-familiarize themselves with this topic.

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
In the introduction paragraph, I explain why Python is so vital to computer science because of its endless capabilities.  From there, I show how data structures, such as the ones I describe in my blog, are essential building blocks in this programming langauge.  I go on to state how there are different ways to store data, each with their own unique perks - so, which method you use can be very important to your program.

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
For each data structure described in the blog - lists, sets, and dictionaries - I use a short definition as an introduction.  I then go on to describe how different actions would be performed on this data structure such as initializing the array, accessing an element, adding an element, removing an element, and more.  I use different examples for different data structures to best illustrate how each of these actions would be performed.  When discussing lists, I also make sure to go in-depth on indexing as the way programmers count could be confusing to beginners.

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
After giving thorough explanations on the different data structures, I highlight the capabilities and limits of each data structure previously mentioned.  I organize most of these key properties into a Venn diagram so that the reader can clearly see what differentiates the arrays from one another.  Finally, I review each data structure individually and point out some of their bonus methods that make them unique and useful, and explain how these methods could theoretically be used in a program.
