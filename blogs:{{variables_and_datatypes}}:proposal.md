### :pushpin: Step 1
**TITLE:**    
{{Introduction to Python Basics: Variables and Data Types}}

**TOPIC:**    
{{Variables and Data Types}}

**DESCRIPTION (5-7+ sentences):**    
{{This blogâ€™s goal is to give readers a basic understanding of python basics Variables and Data Types. The blog will give detailed explanations as well as examples about the two topics. The reader will be reading through the blog and performing the examples while they read. The intent is to provide an interactive component to keep the user engaged. The blog will introduce readers to key concepts and explain how they are used in more complicated Python concepts. }}

### :pushpin: Step 2
:family: **TARGET AUDIENCE (3-5+ sentences):**    
{{The target audience is anyone with any desire to learn Python or someone who has very little programming experience. They will be curious to learn and this blog will serve as a stepping stone towards them continuing to learn Python. More specifically I think this blog can target both high school and college students who wish to learn Python.}}

### :pushpin: Step 3
> Outline your learning/teaching structure: 

**Beginning (2-3+ sentences):**    
{{Assuming the audience has little to no experience with Python concepts I will begin by giving a brief introduction to Variables. As I explain I will provide interactive examples with the reader and urge them to try these examples on their own. After the explanation I will leave questions about concepts explained to keep readers thinking.}}

**Middle (2-3+ sentences):**    
{{In the middle section I will go into depth about Data Types and explain what they are and what the user can do with them. Similar to the beginning part of the blog examples will be inserted to provide an interactive piece to the blog as well as questions at the end of the section. 
}}

**End (2-3+ sentences):**    
{{	After the reader understands what variables and data types are the end will provide an example of a more complicated program which utilizes both concepts. The goal is to explain that these two concepts are key concepts in Python and give them a small taste of what they would see if they decide to continue to learn more.
